			Horse-drawn carriage rides on a halogen-lamp lit road with greens on one side and water on the other; no no
			we
			are not talking about NYC’s Central Park but our very own Futala Lake. Spread over 60 acres with even a
			beach on
			one side, the Futala Lake underwent a massive beautification drive and has today become Nagpur’s most
			attractive, most visited, most relaxing place. The 200-year-old lake houses beautiful, colourful fountai
			ns, food vendors, picnic setups, and many other amenities.

		<p class="h">2. Ambazari Lake </p>
		<p style="font:400 14px Georgia; letter-spacing: 3px;align-items:stretch;line-height: 1.6">The biggest lake in all of Nagpur, Ambazari Lake derives its name from the word ‘amba’ which literally means
			mangoes due to the large number of mango trees found around the lake. The lake was the main source of water
			in
			the past for Naagpurians, however, today the lake is solely used as a breathing space for the city. On the
			lake
			itself, there are boating and musical fountains and even public radios blaring music to amp up the ambience,
			walking tracks, green gym, rides, children's play area and the general food vendors and picnic spots making
			it a
			must-visit for all your chill sessions with your squad or family.

		<p style="font:400 14px Georgia; letter-spacing: 3px;align-items:stretch;line-height: 1.6">
			Rajkamal Tourism and Olive Resort have taken charge of this lake which has been a huge blessing for Nagpur
			as
			the
			lake is now a popular spot to hang out and/or indulge in water sports. The best part is that the natural
			terrain
			of the area around the lake slopes towards it giving the area a feeling of a hill station. Visitors here
			enjoy
			paddle boating, motor boating, adventure sports, lakeside restaurant meals, amuseument park rides, walks,
			and
			sunset watching.

		<p style="font:400 14px Georgia; letter-spacing: 3px;align-items:stretch;line-height: 1.6"> 
			Shukrawari Talao, Gandhi Sagar Lake and Jumma lake - these are all names for the famous Shukrawari Lake.
			Apart
			from its pristine beauty, Shukrawari Lake is known for its uniquely rectangular shape and with the city
			government successfully managing to landscape it, its beauty has never been more picturesque. The
			275-year-old
			lake has a stunning island in the middle which houses a Lord Shiva Temple on it. Regular lake activities
			like
			boating and walking tracks are available here but what’s unbeatable about the lake is its views, especially
			during sunset.
